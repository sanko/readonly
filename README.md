# NAME

Readonly - Facility for creating read-only scalars, arrays, hashes

# Synopsis

    use Readonly;

    # Deep Read-only scalar
    Readonly::Scalar    $sca => $initial_value;
    Readonly::Scalar my $sca => $initial_value;

    # Deep Read-only array
    Readonly::Array    @arr => @values;
    Readonly::Array my @arr => @values;

    # Deep Read-only hash
    Readonly::Hash    %has => (key => value, key => value, ...);
    Readonly::Hash my %has => (key => value, key => value, ...);
    # or:
    Readonly::Hash    %has => {key => value, key => value, ...};

    # You can use the read-only variables like any regular variables:
    print $sca;
    $something = $sca + $arr[2];
    next if $has{$some_key};

    # But if you try to modify a value, your program will die:
    $sca = 7;
    push @arr, 'seven';
    delete $has{key};
    # The error message is "Modification of a read-only value attempted"

    # Alternate form (Perl 5.8 and later)
    Readonly    $sca => $initial_value;
    Readonly my $sca => $initial_value;
    Readonly    @arr => @values;
    Readonly my @arr => @values;
    Readonly    %has => (key => value, key => value, ...);
    Readonly my %has => (key => value, key => value, ...);
    Readonly my $sca; # Implicit undef, readonly value

    # Alternate form (for Perls earlier than v5.8)
    Readonly    \$sca => $initial_value;
    Readonly \my $sca => $initial_value;
    Readonly    \@arr => @values;
    Readonly \my @arr => @values;
    Readonly    \%has => (key => value, key => value, ...);
    Readonly \my %has => (key => value, key => value, ...);

# Description

This is a facility for creating non-modifiable variables. This is useful for
configuration files, headers, etc. It can also be useful as a development and
debugging tool for catching updates to variables that should not be changed.

# Variable Depth

Readonly has the ability to create both deep and shallow readonly variables.

If you pass a `$ref`, an `@array` or a `%hash` to corresponding functions `::Scalar()`, `::Array()` and `::Hash()`, then those functions recurse over the data structure, marking everything as Readonly. The entire structure is then non-modifiable. This is normally what you want.

If you want only the top level to be Readonly, use the alternate (and poorly
named) `::Scalar1()`, `::Array1()`, and `::Hash1()` functions.

Plain `Readonly()` creates what the original author calls a "shallow" read only variable, which is great if you don't plan to use it on anything but one dimensional scalar values.

`Readonly::Scalar()` makes the variable 'deeply' read only, so the following snippet kills over as you expect:
```
use Readonly;

Readonly::Scalar my $ref => { 1 => 'a' };
$ref->{1} = 'b';
$ref->{2} = 'b';
```
While the following snippet does **not** make your structure 'deeply' read only:
```
use Readonly;

Readonly my $ref => { 1 => 'a' };
$ref->{1} = 'b';
$ref->{2} = 'b';
```

# 

# The Past

The following sections are updated versions of the previous authors
documentation.

## Comparison with "use constant"

Perl provides a facility for creating constant values, via the [constant](https://metacpan.org/pod/constant)
pragma. There are several problems with this pragma.

- The constants created have no leading sigils.
- These constants cannot be interpolated into strings.
- Syntax can get dicey sometimes.  For example:

        use constant CARRAY => (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13);
        $a_prime = CARRAY[2];        # wrong!
        $a_prime = (CARRAY)[2];      # right -- MUST use parentheses

- You have to be very careful in places where barewords are allowed.

    For example:

        use constant SOME_KEY => 'key';
        %hash = (key => 'value', other_key => 'other_value');
        $some_value = $hash{SOME_KEY};        # wrong!
        $some_value = $hash{+SOME_KEY};       # right

    (who thinks to use a unary plus when using a hash to scalarize the key?)

- `use constant` works for scalars and arrays, not hashes.
- These constants are global to the package in which they're declared;
cannot be lexically scoped.
- Works only at compile time.
- Can be overridden:

        use constant PI => 3.14159;
        ...
        use constant PI => 2.71828;

    (this does generate a warning, however, if you have warnings enabled).

- It is very difficult to make and use deep structures (complex data
structures) with `use constant`.

# Comparison with typeglob constants

Another popular way to create read-only scalars is to modify the symbol table
entry for the variable by using a typeglob:

    *a = \'value';

This works fine, but it only works for global variables ("my" variables have
no symbol table entry). Also, the following similar constructs do **not** work:

    *a = [1, 2, 3];      # Does NOT create a read-only array
    *a = { a => 'A'};    # Does NOT create a read-only hash

## Pros

Readonly.pm, on the other hand, will work with global variables and with
lexical ("my") variables. It will create scalars, arrays, or hashes, all of
which look and work like normal, read-write Perl variables. You can use them
in scalar context, in list context; you can take references to them, pass them
to functions, anything.

Readonly.pm also works well with complex data structures, allowing you to tag
the whole structure as nonmodifiable, or just the top level.

Also, Readonly variables may not be reassigned. The following code will die:

    Readonly::Scalar $pi => 3.14159;
    ...
    Readonly::Scalar $pi => 2.71828;

## Cons

Readonly.pm used to impose a performance penalty. It was pretty slow. How
slow? Run the `eg/benchmark.pl` script that comes with Readonly. On my test
system, "use constant" (const), typeglob constants (tglob), regular read/write
Perl variables (normal/literal), and the new Readonly (ro/ro\_simple) are all
about the same speed, the old, tie based Readonly.pm constants were about 1/22
the speed.

However, there is relief. There is a companion module available, Readonly::XS.
You won't need this if you're using Perl 5.8.x or higher.

I repeat, you do not need Readonly::XS if your environment has perl 5.8.x or
higher. Please see section entitled [Internals](#internals) for more.

# Functions

- Readonly::Scalar $var => $value;

    Creates a nonmodifiable scalar, `$var`, and assigns a value of `$value` to
    it. Thereafter, its value may not be changed. Any attempt to modify the value
    will cause your program to die.

    A value _must_ be supplied. If you want the variable to have `undef` as its
    value, you must specify `undef`.

    If `$value` is a reference to a scalar, array, or hash, then this function
    will mark the scalar, array, or hash it points to as being Readonly as well,
    and it will recursively traverse the structure, marking the whole thing as
    Readonly. Usually, this is what you want. However, if you want only the
    `$value` marked as Readonly, use `Scalar1`.

    If $var is already a Readonly variable, the program will die with an error
    about reassigning Readonly variables.

- Readonly::Array @arr => (value, value, ...);

    Creates a nonmodifiable array, `@arr`, and assigns the specified list of
    values to it. Thereafter, none of its values may be changed; the array may not
    be lengthened or shortened or spliced. Any attempt to do so will cause your
    program to die.

    If any of the values passed is a reference to a scalar, array, or hash, then
    this function will mark the scalar, array, or hash it points to as being
    Readonly as well, and it will recursively traverse the structure, marking the
    whole thing as Readonly. Usually, this is what you want. However, if you want
    only the hash `%@arr` itself marked as Readonly, use `Array1`.

    If `@arr` is already a Readonly variable, the program will die with an error
    about reassigning Readonly variables.

- Readonly::Hash %h => (key => value, key => value, ...);
- Readonly::Hash %h => {key => value, key => value, ...};

    Creates a nonmodifiable hash, `%h`, and assigns the specified keys and values
    to it. Thereafter, its keys or values may not be changed. Any attempt to do so
    will cause your program to die.

    A list of keys and values may be specified (with parentheses in the synopsis
    above), or a hash reference may be specified (curly braces in the synopsis
    above). If a list is specified, it must have an even number of elements, or
    the function will die.

    If any of the values is a reference to a scalar, array, or hash, then this
    function will mark the scalar, array, or hash it points to as being Readonly
    as well, and it will recursively traverse the structure, marking the whole
    thing as Readonly. Usually, this is what you want. However, if you want only
    the hash `%h` itself marked as Readonly, use `Hash1`.

    If `%h` is already a Readonly variable, the program will die with an error
    about reassigning Readonly variables.

- Readonly $var => $value;
- Readonly @arr => (value, value, ...);
- Readonly %h => (key => value, ...);
- Readonly %h => {key => value, ...};
- Readonly $var;

    The `Readonly` function is an alternate to the `Scalar`, `Array`, and
    `Hash` functions. It has the advantage (if you consider it an advantage) of
    being one function. That may make your program look neater, if you're
    initializing a whole bunch of constants at once. You may or may not prefer
    this uniform style.

    It has the disadvantage of having a slightly different syntax for versions of
    Perl prior to 5.8.  For earlier versions, you must supply a backslash, because
    it requires a reference as the first parameter.

        Readonly \$var => $value;
        Readonly \@arr => (value, value, ...);
        Readonly \%h   => (key => value, ...);
        Readonly \%h   => {key => value, ...};

    You may or may not consider this ugly.

    Note that you can create implicit undefined variables with this function like
    so `Readonly my $var;` while a verbose undefined value must be passed to the
    standard `Scalar`, `Array`, and `Hash` functions.

- Readonly::Scalar1 $var => $value;
- Readonly::Array1 @arr => (value, value, ...);
- Readonly::Hash1 %h => (key => value, key => value, ...);
- Readonly::Hash1 %h => {key => value, key => value, ...};

    These alternate functions create shallow Readonly variables, instead of deep
    ones. For example:

        Readonly::Array1 @shal => (1, 2, {perl=>'Rules', java=>'Bites'}, 4, 5);
        Readonly::Array  @deep => (1, 2, {perl=>'Rules', java=>'Bites'}, 4, 5);

        $shal[1] = 7;           # error
        $shal[2]{APL}='Weird';  # Allowed! since the hash isn't Readonly
        $deep[1] = 7;           # error
        $deep[2]{APL}='Weird';  # error, since the hash is Readonly

# Cloning

When cloning using [Storable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Storable) or [Clone](https://metacpan.org/pod/Clone) you will notice that the value stays
readonly, which is correct. If you want to clone the value without copying the
readonly flag, use the `Clone` function:

    Readonly::Scalar my $scalar = 'string';
    my $scalar_clone = Readonly::Clone $scalar_clone;

    $scalar_clone .= 'foo'; # no error

The new variable (`$scalar_clone`) is a mutable clone of the original
`$scalar`.

# Examples

These are a few very simple examples:

## Scalars

A plain old read-only value

    Readonly::Scalar $a => "A string value";

The value need not be a compile-time constant:

    Readonly::Scalar $a => $computed_value;

## Arrays/Lists

A read-only array:

    Readonly::Array @a => (1, 2, 3, 4);

The parentheses are optional:

    Readonly::Array @a => 1, 2, 3, 4;

You can use Perl's built-in array quoting syntax:

    Readonly::Array @a => qw/1 2 3 4/;

You can initialize a read-only array from a variable one:

    Readonly::Array @a => @computed_values;

A read-only array can be empty, too:

    Readonly::Array @a => ();
    Readonly::Array @a;        # equivalent

## Hashes

Typical usage:

    Readonly::Hash %a => (key1 => 'value1', key2 => 'value2');

A read-only hash can be initialized from a variable one:

    Readonly::Hash %a => %computed_values;

A read-only hash can be empty:

    Readonly::Hash %a => ();
    Readonly::Hash %a;        # equivalent

If you pass an odd number of values, the program will die:

    Readonly::Hash %a => (key1 => 'value1', "value2");
    # This dies with "May not store an odd number of values in a hash"

# Exports

Historically, this module exports the `Readonly` symbol into the calling
program's namespace by default. The following symbols are also available for
import into your program, if you like: `Scalar`, `Scalar1`, `Array`,
`Array1`, `Hash`, and `Hash1`.

# Internals

Some people simply do not understand the relationship between this module and
Readonly::XS so I'm adding this section. Odds are, they still won't understand
but I like to write so...

In the past, Readonly's "magic" was performed by `tie()`-ing variables to the
`Readonly::Scalar`, `Readonly::Array`, and `Readonly::Hash` packages (not
to be confused with the functions of the same names) and acting on `WRITE`,
`READ`, et. al. While this worked well, it was slow. Very slow. Like 20-30
times slower than accessing variables directly or using one of the other
const-related modules that have cropped up since Readonly was released in
2003.

To 'fix' this, Readonly::XS was written. If installed, Readonly::XS used the
internal methods `SvREADONLY` and `SvREADONLY_on` to lock simple scalars. On
the surface, everything was peachy but things weren't the same behind the
scenes. In edge cases, code performed very differently if Readonly::XS was
installed and because it wasn't a required dependency in most code, it made
downstream bugs very hard to track.

In the years since Readonly::XS was released, the then private internal
methods have been exposed and can be used in pure perl. Similar modules were
written to take advantage of this and a patch to Readonly was created. We no
longer need to build and install another module to make Readonly useful on
modern builds of perl.

- You do not need to install Readonly::XS.
- You should stop listing Readonly::XS as a dependency or expect it to
be installed.
- Stop testing the `$Readonly::XSokay` variable!

# Requirements

Please note that most users of Readonly no longer need to install the
companion module Readonly::XS which is recommended but not required for perl
5.6.x and under. Please do not force it as a requirement in new code and do
not use the package variable `$Readonly::XSokay` in code/tests. For more, see
["Internals" in the section on Readonly's new internals](https://metacpan.org/pod/the&#x20;section&#x20;on&#x20;Readonly&#x27;s&#x20;new&#x20;internals#Internals).

There are no non-core requirements.
